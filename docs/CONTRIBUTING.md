# Welcome to the go-athenahealth contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

This project is still in early stages (not yet major version 1), so the contributing process is fairly simple.

## Getting started

### Make Changes

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Install or update to **Go**, at the version specified in `go.mod`.

### Commit your update

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).

- Fill out the [pull request template](./pull_request_template.md) so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. Note that any breaking changes should be called out in your pull request description.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If someone has requested changes on your pull request and you believe you have made all necessary changes you can re-request review from that person using the "Reviewers" feature.
